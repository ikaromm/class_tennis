# Project Design Requirements (PDR) - Tennis Match Prediction Pipeline

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to develop an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting tennis match outcomes. The system will take inputs such as player names, surface type, and other relevant parameters to predict the winner of a tennis match.

## 2. Objectives
- Create a modular, maintainable, and extensible codebase using object-oriented programming principles
- Develop a data ingestion and preprocessing pipeline
- Implement feature engineering specific to tennis match prediction
- Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models
- Create a simple interface for making predictions
- Ensure proper testing and documentation throughout the project

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements
- **Data Collection**: Ability to collect and parse tennis match data from available sources
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, validate, and transform raw data into a format suitable for analysis
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract and create relevant features from tennis match data
- **Model Training**: Train multiple machine learning models to predict match outcomes
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.)
- **Model Selection**: Select the best performing model for deployment
- **Prediction Interface**: Create a simple interface to input match parameters and get predictions
- **Result Interpretation**: Provide explanations for predictions when possible

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Modularity**: Use class-based architecture for easy maintenance and extension
- **Scalability**: Design the system to handle increasing amounts of data
- **Performance**: Optimize for prediction speed and accuracy
- **Maintainability**: Write clean, documented code with proper testing
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent results across different runs

## 4. Data Requirements
- Historical tennis match data including:
  - Player information (name, ranking, handedness, etc.)
  - Match details (tournament, round, surface, date, etc.)
  - Match statistics (aces, double faults, win percentages, etc.)
- Player profile data (age, height, playing style, etc.)
- Tournament and surface information

## 5. Technical Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Testing**: Pytest
- **Documentation**: Sphinx/MkDocs
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Dependency Management**: Poetry/Pip

## 6. Project Phases
1. **Data Collection and Exploration**
   - Gather data from available sources
   - Explore and understand the data structure
   - Identify potential features and patterns

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean and validate data
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize/standardize features

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create player-specific features
   - Develop surface-specific features
   - Generate historical performance metrics

4. **Model Development**
   - Implement baseline models
   - Develop advanced models
   - Tune hyperparameters

5. **Evaluation and Selection**
   - Compare model performance
   - Select best model(s)
   - Analyze feature importance

6. **Interface Development**
   - Create prediction interface
   - Implement result visualization
   - Add explanation capabilities

7. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Write unit and integration tests

   - Create user guide

## 7. Success Criteria
- Prediction accuracy significantly better than baseline (e.g., always predicting higher-ranked player wins)
- Complete, well-documented codebase with test coverage > 80%
- Ability to make predictions with minimal input (just player names and surface)
- Reasonable explanation of prediction factors
