# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) - Tennis Match Prediction Pipeline

## ADR 1: Overall Architecture

### Context
We need to design a modular, maintainable system for tennis match prediction that follows best practices in machine learning pipeline development.

### Decision
We will implement a class-based architecture with clear separation of concerns following these principles:
- Data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction as separate modules
- Abstract base classes for common interfaces
- Factory patterns for model creation
- Pipeline pattern for data flow
- Strategy pattern for different feature engineering approaches

### Consequences
- Increased initial development time due to more complex architecture
- Better maintainability and extensibility in the long run
- Easier testing of individual components
- Clear separation of concerns

## ADR 2: Data Management Strategy

### Context
Tennis match data can be complex, with various sources, formats, and potential inconsistencies.

### Decision
We will implement a comprehensive data management strategy:
1. Use a DataLoader abstract class with concrete implementations for different data sources
2. Implement a caching mechanism to avoid redundant data loading
3. Create a DataValidator class to ensure data quality
4. Use a DataTransformer class for consistent preprocessing

### Consequences
- More robust handling of data inconsistencies
- Reduced data loading time through caching
- Consistent data format throughout the pipeline
- Easier addition of new data sources

## ADR 3: Feature Engineering Approach

### Context
Feature engineering is critical for tennis match prediction, as raw statistics alone may not capture all relevant patterns.

### Decision
We will implement a modular feature engineering system:
1. Create a BaseFeatureEngineer abstract class
2. Implement specialized feature engineers for:
   - Player-specific features (form, playing style, head-to-head)
   - Surface-specific features (performance on different surfaces)
   - Tournament-specific features (performance in different tournaments/rounds)
   - Time-based features (recent form, seasonal patterns)
3. Use a FeaturePipeline class to combine and orchestrate feature generation

### Consequences
- More comprehensive feature set
- Ability to easily add or modify features
- Better organization of domain knowledge
- Potential for feature selection to optimize model performance

## ADR 4: Model Selection and Training

### Context
Different machine learning models may perform differently on tennis prediction tasks.

### Decision
We will implement a model experimentation framework:
1. Create a BaseModel abstract class with common interface
2. Implement various model types (tree-based, neural networks, etc.)
3. Use a ModelFactory for easy model instantiation
4. Implement a systematic evaluation framework with cross-validation
5. Create a model registry to track experiments

### Consequences
- Ability to easily compare different models
- Systematic approach to model selection
- Reproducible training and evaluation process
- Clear tracking of model performance

## ADR 5: Prediction Interface

### Context
The system needs a clean interface for making predictions with minimal input.

### Decision
We will implement a Predictor class that:
1. Takes minimal input (player names, surface)
2. Handles all the necessary data retrieval and feature generation
3. Makes predictions using the best available model
4. Provides confidence scores and explanations
5. Offers both programmatic and CLI interfaces

### Consequences
- Simple interface for end users
- Encapsulation of complex pipeline details
- Ability to explain predictions
- Flexibility in how the system is used

## ADR 6: Testing Strategy

### Context
Ensuring the reliability and correctness of the prediction system is essential.

### Decision
We will implement a comprehensive testing strategy:
1. Unit tests for all classes and methods
2. Integration tests for component interactions
3. End-to-end tests for the complete pipeline
4. Data validation tests to catch data quality issues
5. Performance benchmarks for critical components

### Consequences
- Higher code quality and reliability
- Early detection of bugs and regressions
- Better documentation through tests
- More confidence in system behavior

## ADR 7: Dependency Management and Environment

### Context
Managing dependencies and ensuring reproducibility is important for long-term maintenance.

### Decision
We will use:
1. Poetry for dependency management
2. Virtual environments for isolation
3. Version pinning for all dependencies
4. Configuration files for environment-specific settings
5. Docker containers for deployment (optional)

### Consequences
- Consistent development and production environments
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Better reproducibility of results
- Simplified deployment process
