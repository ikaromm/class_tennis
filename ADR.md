# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) - Tennis Match Prediction Pipeline

## ADR 1: Overall Architecture

### Context
We need to design a modular, maintainable system for tennis match prediction that follows best practices in machine learning pipeline development.

### Decision
We have implemented a class-based architecture with clear separation of concerns following these principles:
- Data loading, parsing, and transformation as separate modules
- Abstract base classes for common interfaces (BaseDataLoader, BaseDataParser)
- Pipeline pattern for data flow through the system
- Transformer pattern for data processing steps
- Configuration-driven approach for flexibility

### Structure
```
src/
├── loader/                # Data loading modules
├── source_parser/         # Parsing modules for different data sources
├── transformers/          # Data transformation modules
├── cache/                 # Caching mechanisms
├── config/                # Configuration modules
└── pipeline.py            # Main pipeline orchestration
```

### Consequences
- Improved maintainability through modular design
- Enhanced extensibility for adding new data sources and transformations
- Better testability of individual components
- Clear separation of concerns between data loading, parsing, and transformation

## ADR 2: Data Management Strategy

### Context
Tennis match data can be complex, with various sources, formats, and potential inconsistencies.

### Decision
We have implemented a comprehensive data management strategy:
1. A modular approach with separate components:
   - Loader modules for different data sources (e.g., CSVDataLoader)
   - Source parsers for handling different data formats (e.g., TennisMatchParser)
   - Transformers for data preprocessing
2. Factory methods (from_config) to instantiate appropriate components based on configuration
3. Consistent data flow through the pipeline
4. Logging transformers to track data changes

### Consequences
- More robust handling of data inconsistencies
- Consistent data format throughout the pipeline
- Easier addition of new data sources
- Better visibility into data transformations

## ADR 3: Configuration Management

### Context
The system needs flexible configuration options to support different execution environments and parameter settings.

### Decision
We have implemented a dedicated configuration module that:
1. Provides centralized configuration management through PipelineConfig
2. Defines enums for different types (LoadType, DatasetType)
3. Enables configuration-driven component instantiation
4. Maintains separation between code and configuration

### Consequences
- More flexible system behavior
- Easier parameter tuning
- Better reproducibility of experiments
- Simplified deployment to different environments

## ADR 4: Pipeline Architecture

### Context
The system needs to coordinate multiple processing steps in a consistent way.

### Decision
We have implemented a pipeline architecture that:
1. Defines a clear flow of data through the system via the PipelineRunner class
2. Follows a sequential processing model: load → parse → transform → save
3. Applies transformers sequentially to the data
4. Supports configuration-driven pipeline construction

### Consequences
- More structured data flow
- Better error handling and recovery
- Improved observability through logging transformers
- Easier extension with new processing steps

## ADR 5: Transformer Pattern

### Context
Data processing often involves multiple sequential transformations that need to be applied consistently.

### Decision
We have implemented a transformer pattern where:
1. Each transformer is a callable that takes a DataFrame and returns a transformed DataFrame
2. Transformers are registered with the pipeline and applied sequentially
3. Simple transformers like log_data provide visibility into the data flow

### Consequences
- More flexible data processing
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier testing of individual transformations
- Improved maintainability

## ADR 6: Caching Strategy

### Context
Tennis data processing can be computationally expensive, and some operations may be repeated.

### Decision
We have implemented a dedicated caching module that:
1. Defines a cache interface for storing intermediate results
2. Provides mechanisms to avoid redundant processing
3. Supports different storage options

### Consequences
- Improved performance for repeated operations
- Reduced computational overhead
- Better resource utilization

## ADR 7: Testing Strategy

### Context
Ensuring the reliability and correctness of the prediction system is essential.

### Decision
We have implemented a comprehensive testing strategy:
1. Unit tests for individual components (test_loader, test_parser, test_config)
2. Integration tests for component interactions (test_pipeline)
3. Test utilities for common testing operations

### Consequences
- Higher code quality and reliability
- Early detection of bugs and regressions
- Better documentation through tests
- More confidence in system behavior

## ADR 8: Dependency Management and Environment

### Context
Managing dependencies and ensuring reproducibility is important for long-term maintenance.

### Decision
We are using:
1. Poetry for dependency management (as seen in pyproject.toml)
2. Virtual environments for isolation
3. Version pinning for all dependencies
4. Separate dependency groups for development

### Consequences
- Consistent development and production environments
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Better reproducibility of results
- Simplified dependency management
